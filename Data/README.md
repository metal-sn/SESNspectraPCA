# SESNspectraPCA/Data

This directory contains the <b>/DataProducts</b> directory where the pickled SNID datasets used in [Williamson & Modjaz & Bianco (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06815) are stored. Each pickled dataset is already preprocessed according to the method in Williamson & Modjaz & Bianco. The <b>SESNspectraPCA/code/Tutorial.ipynb</b> notebook demonstrates how to load these datasets. <b>snlist.txt</b> is a list of all the SESNe that should be present after compiling the SESNe SNID spectral dataset following the instructions on the home page.
