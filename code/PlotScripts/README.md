# PlotScripts

This directory contains simple scripts that generate the plots found in [Williamson & Modjaz & Bianco (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06815). <b>FigX.py</b> generates Figure X in the paper. <b>eig.py</b> generates a plot with 5 panels, where each panel corresponds to one of the first 5 eigenspectra. In each panel, the corresponding eigenspectrum is plotted at each of the 4 phase ranges.
